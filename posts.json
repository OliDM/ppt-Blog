They covered topics like making views, routes and passing parameters to views.</p><p>well thats it for entry number 1 stay tuned.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Time for more tinkering, after getting the routes and the views done(at least the front end), came the time to put some logic into them. Getting a list of posts filtered by author or by ID was a no brainer after looking at the docs for datamapper, yet the tags was more complicated because i either couldn't figure out how to use the gems correctly on the model or they came made for a specific ORM. It was then that i stumbled upon dm-taggings which solved most of my needs and was made for datamapper.</p>",
